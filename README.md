# Medisafe
Deltahacks Project

MediSafe is an innovative solution to people who need to be careful about what they ingest, ensuring that it does not conflict with their medication.

See the following instructions on running the individual components of the code.
- Java Webscraper, run java and then javac to run the webscraper, ensuring a connection to the internet
- To run the Android App, open the directory in Android Studio and navigate to the root directory. You can either run the app on your phone or on the Android Studio phone simulator, which you may have to install. Make sure to set up the localhost from the flask_todo/main.py to set up the localhost server for the app to connect to. Email linofbaoze@outlook.com for any further questions.
